# ARK in js

A rough implementation of some functionalities of the [Alternate Reality Kit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1HhPE0zV6g), with some slight modifications and "modern" graphics.

Goals:

- [ ] implement most demos shown in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1HhPE0zV6g), with "Smalltalk" changed to "Javascript"
- [ ] write an interactive tutorial on basic concepts and usage, linking to some ARK info
- [ ] write an interactive walkthrough of the codebase

Non-goals:

- package into a library
- actually useful for making simulations
- runs fast
- implement all functionalities from ARK
